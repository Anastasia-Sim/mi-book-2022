# Day 04: Data visualization

Welcome to day üçÄ of this module, where we will be learning an important yet often neglected skill: data visualization. 
You'll find that the process of making compelling visualizations is not-too-hard when done programmatically and _easily_ makes you stand out amongst your peers. üòè

```{note}
Today's lessons will be fairly self-guided, so feel free to proceed through the following content at your own pace.
```


## Goals for today

- Learn how to visualize data programmatically using [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) in Python.
