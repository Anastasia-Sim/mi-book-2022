# Homework


## Reading  

We recommend revisiting the papers by [Petousis et al.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yGQ7G8n_DrLdpsC9e72gb3eKSAGP5-AU/view?usp=sharing) on the dielectric constants datatset {cite}`g3-petousis_2017` and by [Robertson](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cLXY2B3ZAPKHfLrwlsyCVMVfVQzDIEac/view?usp=sharing) on high-$\kappa$ oxides {cite}`g3-robertson_2004`.
Even if you read a paper once before, it never hurts to do another pass!
We hope that by doing so, you get a better sense of which properties should be the outputs and which might be good inputs.



## Programming

We recommend reviewing the ML exercises from today, which covered quite a lot of information in a very short amount of time.

If you want to try **applying your knowledge**, see if you can build a vanilla linear model for your dielectric materials.
Be sure to consider:
  - Is this a regression or classification problem?
  - What are the inputs and what are the output(s)?
  - Where will I get the data? Hint: you should already have them!
  - What tools will help me? Hint: `pandas` and `scikit-learn`.

See the accompanying notebook for some guided exercises, if you would find that helpful.
