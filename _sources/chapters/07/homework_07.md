however, sometimes it helps to hear a different perspective on the same issue, so we recommend **skimming** the primer by [Wang et al.](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ybj77q1RvHAIzX1CnV2eEEJr78hicAZQ/view?usp=sharing) {cite}`h3-wang_2020`.
There are some nice ideas in there!


## Programming

No new programming assignments! 
We encourage you to work with your team to decide what data you will need and how to consolidate it in one place (e.g., a single table that you can save as a CSV file for repeated future use).
