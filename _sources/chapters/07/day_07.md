# Day 07: ML speedrun (pt. 2)

Welcome to day ðŸŽ° where we will continue our whirlwind tour of ML. 
Today we'll be focused on inputs and some advanced ML models that are effective for materials informatics.
After today, you'll have all of the tools you need to complete your projects!


## Goals for today

- Discuss various featurizations for materials and some advanced ML models and the intuition behind them so we can identify their utility.
- Practice implementing these concepts using [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) in Python.



## Timing for today

- Today's schedule is identical to {doc}`../06/day_06`.
