# Peer review

We are discussing peer review in this module because it is an important part of the research endeavor and scientific discourse.
What's surprising, however, is that while we are taught how to do science and how to write up _our own_ work, we're never really taught how to write about _others'_ work, whether it's a summary, critique, constructive criticism, or something else.
Maybe this is why so many scientists have to face the diatribe of [Reviewer #2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1TALPFg4G8Cs0_V-KgdtkDsewhqPJMZps/view?usp=sharing) {cite}`o1-cranford_2020`.
Since giving feedback and receiving feedback is valuable to everyone, we will practice it here, in the context of our final presentations.
