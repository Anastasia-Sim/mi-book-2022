# Homework

## Reading  

1. The first is [a short 2-page paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YMPXFK3XPTCBDWABkOYEeeF_Sua-K3Us/view?usp=sharing) on, well, how to read a paper, by S. Keshav {cite}`d3-keshav_2007`. 
More information can be found on the previous page, {doc}`reading_papers`.
    - We recommend taking a look so that all of your future readings will feel more bearable and productive.
1. [The perspective](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1t4i6gC-uyLAVXxgWy0k1NiRkEqrLtEn3/view?usp=sharing) by [Danielle Szafir](https://danielleszafir.com/) on data visualization {cite}`d3-szafir_2018`.
    - There are many pretty pictures and should be a fun read!
    Just reading the figure captions is fine if you don't have time for the whole article.
    - This article is to set the stage for tomorrow's discussion.
  



## Programming

We encourage you to work with your team to decide what data you will need and how to consolidate it in one place (e.g., a single table that you can save as a CSV file for repeated future use).
We also want to give you some time to review the exercises and readings from the previous two days to help you prepare.
If you're ready to move on or are looking for some more guided practice, we have a suggested sequence of steps for you to apply your newfound knowledge;
but by all means do what feels best for you!
