# Homework

## Reading  

1. The first is [a short 2-page paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1YMPXFK3XPTCBDWABkOYEeeF_Sua-K3Us/view?usp=sharing) on, well, how to read a paper, by S. Keshav {cite}`keshav_2007`. 
More information can be found on the previous page, {doc}`reading_papers`.
    - We recommend taking a look so that all of your future readings will feel more bearable and productive.
  
No new readings!
Though you may want to have a [Markdown cheat sheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet) handy for stylizing your _Markdown cells_ in the Jupyter notebook so you can write notes/prose to yourself and your teammates (we only covered how to write Python code in Code cells).



## Programming

No new programming assignments! 
We encourage you to work with your team to decide what data you will need and how to consolidate it in one place (e.g., a single table that you can save as a CSV file for repeated future use).
