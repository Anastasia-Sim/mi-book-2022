# Day 11: Juneteenth

In observance of [Juneteenth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth) (which is on a Sunday this year), today is a holiday! 🙌🏿
This means:

Please **do not**:

- Show up to morning scrum or afternoon debrief (unless you want to be a [one person band](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=01GY7zYN-ps)). 🦗
- Do research (unless it brings you joy and reduces stress). 🤪


Please **do**:

- Recharge your batteries. 🛌
- Eat lots of good food. 😋
- Spend some quality time with the people you care about. ❤    

We look forward to seeing you tomorrow!
