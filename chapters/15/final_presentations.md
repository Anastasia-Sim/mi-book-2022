# Final presentations

**This is it**!
After three weeks of intense focus on MI, you're ready to showcase what you've learned in your self-directed research projects.
We'll be starting final presentations at **10:00PM PDT** and you're welcome to invite family and friends to this event! ðŸ™Œ

Before then, please edit the appropriate sub-page to add everything in square brackets: 

- Your emoji ([Emojipedia](https://emojipedia.org/))
- Presentation title
- Description
- A relevant figure that you created

Detailed instructions for how to do this can be found in Tuesday's mini-lesson on {doc}`../14/pull_requests`.

The following presenters are ordered alphabetically by first name.

To our guests: Check out the cool projects these students have made! ðŸ˜Ž
