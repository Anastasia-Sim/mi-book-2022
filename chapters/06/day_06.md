# Day 06: ML speedrun (pt. 1)

Welcome to day 🎲 where we will finally learn about the granddaddy of them all: **machine learning (ML)**. 😎
Based on student feedback, we've decided to split this lesson across two days to make it more manageable.
Today we will discuss the general, foundational principles as well as special considerations for MI.



## Goals for today

- Introduce fundamental concepts and terms associated with supervised ML.
- Practice implementing these concepts using [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html) in Python.
- Discuss practical considerations when doing ML (for MSE, and more broadly).



## Timing for today

- We will kick off the day at 9:00AM.
- We will have a mix of lectures and exercises, interspersed with several short breaks.
- Enze will hold drop-in OH from 2:00PM to 3:00PM. 🐢
- We will have our afternoon debrief at the scheduled time.
