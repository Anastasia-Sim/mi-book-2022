Have a great weekend! ðŸŒŠ


## Video

We recommend watching this 50-minute seminar given by Dr. Julia Ling on some of challenges of machine learning in materials science.
She was one of Enze's mentors when they were both at Citrine.
The presentation is well structured and has good examples.

## Reading  

No new readings!
If you have time, we recommend going back and re-reading [the paper](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1m908yMJb6WnSuxqlvpx_m-ey7xCblkhy/view?usp=sharing) by Butler et al.{cite}`f1-butler_2018` On Monday we will dive straight into ML!


## Programming

No new programming assignments! 
We encourage you to work with your team to decide what data you will need and how to consolidate it in one place (e.g., a single table that you can save as a CSV file for repeated future use).
